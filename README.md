A command line application that has the functionality of a to-do list.
  
  - prompts the user to enter chores or tasks, and it stores them in a permanent location (files);
  
  - allows the user to enter as many tasks as desired but stops storing tasks when entering a blank task;
  
  - tasks are categorized into different categories which can be interacted with (create, delete, modify, etc.), and have different priorities which can be sorted/displayed after; 

  - tasks can be displayed entirely or, for example, by category;
  
  - enables the user to remove a task of choice from the list, to signify it's been completed;
